<H1>WORK IN PROGRESS...</H1>
So far I have only been able to successfully dump the 369 in 1 multicart cartridge (when dealing with this multicart, it is necessary to start the game on a GBA or DS before dumping, so that the game is selected in memory. If there is an error in the dump and it is necessary to redo it, you will need to start the game again on a console).

I believe that it is only working on this cartridge because the dump method used in this project is only compatible with EEPROM memories, which I imagine is used on this cartridge. I only have bootleg cartridges of individual games that I believe use flash memory for saves and that is why it is not working, but perhaps with some adaptation in the code it will solve the problem.
