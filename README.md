<H1>WORK IN PROGRESS...</H1>
So far I have only been able to successfully dump the 369 in 1 multicart cartridge game saves (when dealing with this multicart, it is necessary to start the game on a GBA or DS console before dumping, so that the game is selected in memory.)

I believe that it is only working on this cartridge because the dump method used in this project is only compatible with this cartridge's memory, where i think there is using a eeprom. maybe works with sram too, but i only have bootleg cartridges of individual games that I believe use a single flash memory for both rom/ram and that is why i think is not working, but perhaps with some adaptation in the code it will solve the problem.
